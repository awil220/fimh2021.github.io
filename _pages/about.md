Welcome to the FIMH-2021 –– the 11th biennial meeting on Functional Imaging and Modeling of the Heart. FIMH-2021 will be held from **June 21-24, 2021** on the Stanford University campus.

FIMH-2021 will celebrate 20 years of bringing together friends, colleagues, and collaborators to share and discuss the latest in cardiac and cardiovascular imaging, electrophysiology, computational modeling, and translational applications.

The accepted proceedings will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science [LNCS](http://www.springer.com/lncs).

Information about paper submission for the conference can be found under the Manuscript Submission tab.

Scientists and clinicians with an interest in advanced methods to study and evaluate cardiac structure (cell to whole organ), function (regional to global), flow (measured and simulated), electrical activity, and remodeling are all welcome to attend.

An important goal of this meeting is to promote the careers of young scientists, openly discuss new ideas, build new collaborations, and foster an inclusive community to promote the personal and academic well-being of all participants.

We look forward to seeing you at FIMH-2021.

Very best,

Dan, Luigi, and Vicky
