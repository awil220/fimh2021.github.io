title: "MIS-C special theme session"
---

**June 24 - 7 am to 8:30 am PDT**

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C, PIMS-TS), is a rare but serious condition associated with the coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 appearing in children typically of the age 4-18 years. It is caused by a delayed aberrant reaction of the immune system to the coronavirus. It affects various organs and organ systems, of which the cardiovascular system is the most common (80% of patients). 80% of MIS-C patients end at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalization (cardiovascular shock and heart failure). 
 
In this special theme session, clinicians and non-clinical speakers will introduce the disease, present some cardiac modeling techniques which could contribute during the acute stage at ICU, and show imaging and advanced image analysis tools used to monitor the long-term consequences post MIS-C. The aim is to create an environment for a dialogue with multi-disciplinary contributions. Ample time will be devoted to discussion. 
 
Organizers:       
* Radomir Chabiniok, UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas
