Springer encourages authors to include their [ORCIDs](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid?wt_mc=Other.Other.1.AUT642.ORCID+proceedings+pilot+2017&utm_medium=other&utm_source=other&utm_content=8232017&utm_campaign=1_barz01_orcid+proceedings+pilot+2017) in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a [Consent-to-Publish form](). The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.
