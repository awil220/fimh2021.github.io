Open access prices can be found [here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings).
3. If the research presented by the authors has been funded by NIH or any other **agencies with public access policies**, authors can submit to PubMed the same copy submitted to LNCS. There is **no embargo** after the paper has been published in LNCS (i.e., after the conference date.) Please remember that <ins>  is the authors' responsability to submit their papers </ins> to PubMed and adhere to the funding agency and LNCS guidelines, this process is not automatic.

Please make sure that any colored figures are equally comprehensible in black and white. Figures and Tables should be cross referred in the text. Color in text, tables or in equations is not supported.
<!--- 9. If a paper includes an **Appendix**, it should be placed in front of the references. If there is only one, it is designated “Appendix”; if there are more than one, they are designated “Appendix1,” “Appendix 2,” etc. -->
