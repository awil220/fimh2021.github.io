title: "Meet the experts"
---

The “Meet the expert” sessions provide an informal setting for trainees to interact with more experienced scientists (see below).
We are looking to create a relaxed environment where trainees and the expert will discuss career advice, approaches to research, or creative solutions to work-life balance. We have organized two sessions to accommodate different time zones. 
**Interested trainees can sign up during registration.**

**Session 1 (US & Pacific)**
June 22 - 12:00 pm to 12:45 pm PDT
