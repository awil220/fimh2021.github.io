title: "Cardiac Kinematics Benchmark"
---

FIMH-2021 will host a cardiac Kinematics Benchmark. More information about the benchmark is forthcoming.

Cardiac strains can be used as a biomarker to characterize cardiac function in health and disease. However, a large range of cardiac strains is 
reported in the literature, even for healthy volunteers. Several causes could be considered for this large spread, among which the processing methods
adopted to compute cardiac strains from acquired displacement and, if available, microstructural data. As acquired displacements are inherently noisy, different processing methods may amplify or reduce the experimental error as well as introduce a bias in the computed strains. 

In order to improve the use of cardiac strains as biomarkers for cardiac function and dysfunction and compare strains reported in different studies, 
it is necessary to evaluate the variability introduced by different processing methods. Thus, the goal of this benchmark is to characterize cardiac strains
variation due to different processing methods and pipelines. 

To achieve this goal we propose to analyze three sets of data, from which cardiac strains are then computed and compared across groups:
1. An analytically generated set of displacements and myofiber directions are provided for which exact analytical strains are known.
2. Midventricular DENSE images and cDTI data are provided for N=3 healthy swine subjects.
3. Midventricular DENSE images and cDTI data are provided for N=2 swine subjects with an infarct.

A detailed description of the data and the quantities to be reported can be found here.

We hope that this comparison will provide:
1. Insights on the variability of cardiac strain values reported in the literature for healthy volunteers and patients with cardiomyopathies.
2. A platform to discuss different approaches and highlight their advantages with respect to one another.

We look forward to your participation and input to make this a successful discussion. We want to highlight that this benchmark is not meant as a challenge but simply as a platform for discussion and comparison to improve the calculation of cardiac strain values and improve our confidence to distinguish between cardiac health and disease based on this biomarker.

If you are interested in keeping up to date with this benchmark, please subscribe to this mailing list. Using this mailing list, we will announce a
future date when we can discuss the benchmark data and clarify any doubts in a zoom meeting with all interested participants.
