title: "Cardiac Kinematics Benchmark"
---

FIMH-2021 will host a Cardiac Kinematics Benchmark study which aims to establish a platform for 1) discussing variability in calculation of cardiac kinematics (displacement and strain); 2) validating kinematics analysis tools using computational phantoms; 3) comparing kinematics measurements using pre-clinical swine data across different analysis tools; and 4) improving our confidence in cardiac strain estimates as an imaging biomarker to distinguish between healthy and diseased hearts. 

<!--- We hope that this benchmark study will provide:
1. Insights on the variability of cardiac strain values reported in the literature for healthy volunteers and patients with cardiomyopathies.
2. A platform to discuss different approaches and highlight their advantages with respect to one another. -->

**Motivation**

Cardiac strains can be used as an imaging biomarker to characterize cardiac function in health and disease. However, a large range of cardiac strains is 
reported in the literature, even for healthy volunteers. Several factors could contribute to this large spread, among which the processing methods
adopted to compute cardiac strains from acquired displacement and, if available, microstructural data play an important role. As acquired displacement imaging data are inherently noisy, different processing methods may amplify or reduce the experimental error as well as introducing a bias in the computed strains. 

In order to improve our confidence in using cardiac strain as biomarkers for cardiac function and dysfunction and compare strains reported in different studies, 
it is necessary to evaluate the variability introduced by different processing methods. To this end, the goal of this benchmark study is to characterize cardiac strains variation due to different processing methods and pipelines. 

**Benchmark Approach**

To achieve this goal, we propose to analyze three sets of cine DENSE (Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes) data, from which cardiac strains are computed and compared across participants. Cine-DENSE MRI encodes myocardial tissue displacement as the phase of the MR signal at the voxel level, thus it could potentially be the optimal displacement imaging method.

**Input data**

The three sets of cine DENSE data consist of: 
1. Synthetic cine DENSE images generated from a computational cylindrical phantom in which displacements are analytically defined and exact analytic strains are also known.
2. Midventricular cine DENSE images and cDTI (cardiac diffusion tensor imaging) data for N=2 healthy swine subjects (incorporating cDTI data is optional.)
3. Midventricular cine DENSE images and cDTI data for N=2 swine subjects with an infarct (incorporating cDTI data is optional.)

**Output data**

Each participant can use their preferred analysis tool to analyze the data above. Strain results will then be collected and summarized by the benchmark organizers. 

A detailed description of the data and the quantities to be reported can be found here.


**Dissemination of the Cardiac Kinematics Benchmark study**

The organizers of the benchmark study have been in contact with two journals (Frontiers in Physiology (open access) or Philosophical Transactions A (open access available) regarding setting up a special issue on this benchmark study.The exact journal for a special issue is to be determined and highly dependent on interest from the participants. Our goal is to give each participant, the option to submit their analysis tool (if not already published) and benchmark study results as a full-length journal article in a journal special issue. 

**Participation form and mailing list**

We look forward to your participation and input to make this a successful discussion. We want to highlight that this benchmark is not meant as a challenge but simply as a platform for discussion and comparison to improve the calculation of cardiac strain values and improve our confidence to distinguish between cardiac health and disease based on this biomarker.

If you are interested in participating this study, we kindly ask you to fill out this form so that it can help the organizers to gather participantâ€™s information. If you would like to keeping up to date with this benchmark, please subscribe to this mailing list. Using this mailing list, we will announce a future date when we can discuss the benchmark data and clarify any doubts in a zoom meeting with all interested participants.
